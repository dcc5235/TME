# TME
work in progress

A command line tool to run in other projects for testing and built from scratch.

---

## TESTING Node-based CLI framework
- run command line npm init -y to download package.json file
- input test requirements in both index.js file and package.json file
- then run command line npm link to be able to use tme as test framework 

---

## Test Implementation
- file collection: find all files ending in test.js recursively through a folder
- test environment setup: store a reference to each file found
- test file execution: execute them one by one
- report results
